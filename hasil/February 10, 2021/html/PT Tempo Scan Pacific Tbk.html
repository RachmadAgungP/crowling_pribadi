(Quoted from: (www.temposcangroup.com) Currently PT Tempo Scan Pacific Tbk, is re-opening job vacancies for young professionals to have a career with us as follows: <p> For some people, finding a job is quite difficult. even if getting a job it's easy, it's not necessarily what we want. The most important thing now is effort, enthusiasm, and trying. No matter how difficult it is to find work, we still believe we still have Allah SWT who is rich and never gives up. </p>
                        <p> Failure does not mean you end up living life, when you are still given the joy of life while continuing to try and learn in developing a business. People may think you have failed. But if you are still struggling to try and enjoy life, then you are not in failure. The Duration of Your Life Will Be Short When Revenge Fills Your Head. Don't let the contents of your head and your days be filled with resentment, because that will make your life full of darkness and will have no meaning. The end is to shorten your life.

And those who dare to try are those who will have real dreams and dreams. </p> </p><hr><h5>1.
