People may think you have failed. But if you are still struggling to try and enjoy life, then you are not in failure. The Duration of Your Life Will Be Short When Revenge Fills Your Head. Don't let the contents of your head and your days be filled with resentment, because that will make your life full of darkness and will have no meaning. The end is to shorten your life.

And those who dare to try are those who will have real dreams and dreams. </p> </p><hr><h5>Web Developer & Administrator</h5><p>Kualifikasi</p><ol><li>Pendidikan min.
