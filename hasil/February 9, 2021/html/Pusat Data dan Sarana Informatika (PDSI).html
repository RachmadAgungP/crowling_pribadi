Don't let the contents of your head and your days be filled with resentment, because that will make your life full of darkness and will have no meaning. The end is to shorten your life.

And those who dare to try are those who will have real dreams and dreams. </p> </p><hr><h5>Junior Software Developer</h5><p>Kualifikasi umum :</p><ol><li>Bachelor Degree of IT related fields</li></ol><p>Kompetensi :</p><ol><li>Familiarity with PHP 7</li><li>Great Passion for Clean and SOLID Code</li><li>Laravel 5+</li><li>Database: PostgreSQL</li><li>Git</li></ol><p>Deskripsi Pekerjaan :</p><ol><li>Analyze Requirements for implementing new web application features</li><li>Implementing and maintaining existing web applications</li><li>Implementing and maintaining API services</li></ol><hr><p>Cara melamar</p><p>Jika berminat dan sesuai dengan kualifikasi lowongan kerja yang dibutuhkan Pusat Data dan Sarana Informatika (PDSI), silahkan DAFTAR secara online melalui tautan berikut :</p><div class="wp-block-button;"> <a class="wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-background" style="border-radius:2px;background-color:#1d345b;color:#fffffa;" href="https://seleksi.kominfo.go.id/info-seleksi/junior-developer" >Apply</a></div>"<p></p><p>Perhatian :</p><p>Batas akhir pendaftaran 12 Februari 2021</p><p>Pelamar yang lolos seleksi administrasi akan diberitahu melalui email atau telepon resmi</p><p>Hanya pelamar terbaik yang akan diproses untuk mengikuti seleksi</p><p>Seluruh tahapan seleksi ini tidak dipungut biaya.</p>
