    <p> For some people, finding a job is quite difficult. even if getting a job is easy, it's not necessarily what we
      want. The most important thing now is effort, passion, and trying. No matter how difficult it is to find work, we
      still believe that we still have Allah SWT who is rich and never gives up. </p>
    <p> Failure does not mean you end up living life, when you are still given the joy of life while continuing to try
      and learn in developing a business. People may think you have failed. But if you are still struggling to try and
      enjoy life, then you are not in failure. The Duration of Your Life Will Be Short When Revenge Fills Your Head.
      Don't let the contents of your head and your days be filled with resentment, because that will make your life full
      of darkness and will have no meaning. The end is to shorten your life. Those Who Dare to Hear Are Those Who Have a
      Million Wishes. Those Who Dare to See Are Those Who Have A Million Dreams. And those who dare to try are those who
      will have real dreams and dreams. </p>
