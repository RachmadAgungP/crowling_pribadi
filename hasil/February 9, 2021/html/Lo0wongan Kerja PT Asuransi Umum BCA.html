(quoted from: www.bcainsurance.co.id) Currently PT Asuransi Umum BCA, is re-opening job vacancies for young professionals for careers with us as follows: <p> For some people, finding a job is something that is quite difficult. even if getting a job is easy, it's not necessarily what we want. The most important thing now is effort, passion, and trying. No matter how difficult it is to find work, we still believe that we still have Allah SWT who is rich and never gives up. </p>
                        <p> Failure does not mean you end up living life, when you are still given the joy of life while continuing to try and learn in developing a business. People may think you have failed. But if you are still struggling to try and enjoy life, then you are not in failure. The Duration of Your Life Will Be Short When Revenge Fills Your Head. Don't let the contents of your head and your days be filled with resentment, because that will make your life full of darkness and will have no meaning. The end is to shorten your life. Those Who Dare to Hear Are Those Who Have a Million Wishes. Those Who Dare to See Are Those Who Have A Million Dreams. And those who dare to try are those who will have real dreams and dreams. </p> </p><hr><h5>Basic Development Program (BDP)</h5><p>Kualifikasi :</p><ol><li>Pendidikan S1 diutamakan jurusan Ekonomi, Teknik, Komunikasi, MIPA (Matematika, Statistik, Kimia, Fisika)</li><li>IPK minimal 3.00</li><li>Usia maksimal 26 tahun</li><li>Menguasai Bahasa Inggris dengan baik menjadi nilai tambah (aktif dan pasif)</li><li>Memiliki kemampuan analisa dan komunikasi yang baik</li><li>Bersedia ditempatkan di seluruh wilayah Indonesia</li></ol><hr><p>Cara melamar</p><p>Jika berminat dan sesuai dengan kualifikasi lowongan kerja yang dibutuhkan PT Asuransi Umum BCA, silahkan DAFTAR secara online dan kirim CV terbaru kalian juga ke email berikut :</p><div class="wp-block-button;"> <a class="wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-background" style="border-radius:2px;background-color:#1d345b;color:#fffffa;" href="https://cdc.uns.ac.id/lowongan/perusahaan/540/bcainsurance" >Apply</a></div>"<p>email : hrd_bdp@bcainsurance.co.id</p><p>Perhatian :</p><p>Pelamar yang lolos seleksi administrasi akan diberitahu melalui email atau telepon resmi</p><p>Hanya pelamar terbaik yang akan diproses untuk mengikuti seleksi</p><p>Seluruh tahapan seleksi ini tidak dipungut biaya.</p><p></p>
