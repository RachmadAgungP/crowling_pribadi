Standard Oil Company of California (Socal) dan Texas Oil Company (Texaco) membentuk sebuah perusahaan patungan di daerah Sumatra, bernama N.V. Nederlandsche Pacific Petroleum Maatschappij atau NPPM. Perusahaan ini menemukan sebuah sumur minyak non-produktif yang akhirnya ditutup. Pada tahun 1944, ahli geologi NPPM, Richard H. Hopper dan Toru Oki bersama timnya menemukan sumur minyak terbesar di Asia Tenggara, Minas. Sumur ini awalnya bernama Minas No. 1. Minas terkenal dengan jenis minyak Sumatra Light Crude (SLC) yang baik dan memiliki kadar belerang rendah.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Saat ini PT Chevron Pacific Indonesia membuka lowongan kerja terbaru pada bulan Desember 2020.
